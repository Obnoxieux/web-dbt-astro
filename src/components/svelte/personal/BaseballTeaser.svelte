        <p>I have been a big fan of the beautiful sport of baseball for a long time, both as a player, scorekeeper administrative staff member and occasional youth coach.</p>
        <p>I have always loved the versatility required from its players, the unique atmosphere at games which can range from a relaxed Sunday afternoon picnic to a tense nailbiting affair coming down to the last pitch thrown.</p>
