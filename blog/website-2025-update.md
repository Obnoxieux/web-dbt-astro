As is customary with developers, I tend to create more side projects that I can handle instead of finishing the other ones
I already have. So, naturally, I decided to move this website to a new stack for no real reason whatsoever.

## History

Originally built in 2023 as my first real dip into personal web development, I chose 
[SvelteKit](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/introduction#What-is-SvelteKit) as my JS framework of the day. Because I had no clue about
CSS back then, I just slapped [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com) on it and called it a day.

## New kid on the block

Fast-forward to 2025 â€” like every JS developer, I have developed a love-hate-hate-relationship with the JS ecosystem dependency hell, but cannot be bothered 
to rewrite the whole thing from scratch. Since you should always replace your site that is working perfectly fine with 
the newest trendy JS framework of the day, I went ahead and dove right in.

I always wanted to experiment with different frontend stacks, so [Astro](https://astro.build)
offered a very compelling argument to be able to do this in the same project without needing to do the boring work,
like finding an actual use case.

I swapped out the SvelteKit part for Astro routing, but kept most of the Svelte code that powered the dynamic content on
the projects and personal page. Frontend visuals are staying as-is for now, but the new foundation allowed me to easily include a
blog section with the content you are reading right now.

## Note to my readers <sup>sic</sup>

I invested absolutely zero marketing effort for this website. If you are reading this and you are _not_:

- a bot
- some of the random dudes and dudettes contacting me with scammy offers for business cooperation
- a coworker
- my mum

then I would be really interested in the fact how the actual fuck people end up on websites like this in 2025 anymore,
where the internet is a gated community of garbage social media platforms and AI slop. So, please [write me a hello message](/contact)
and tell me what a sorry excuse for a web developer I am.

## Shoutout of the day

Go read what my brother (a real developer) is doing with AI that is not slop[^1]:
